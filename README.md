Hybrid Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch, SpaCy & Google's API
Overview
This project implements a hybrid sentiment analysis system using PyTorch, SpaCy, and Google's Natural Language API. It classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral, combining a custom LSTM model with Google's API for comparison. Right now, it's trained on only 5 examples, so performance is limitedâ€”but the focus is on demonstrating skills in these AI libraries.

How It Works
Preprocessing with SpaCy â€“ Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
Custom Dataset Handling â€“ A ReviewDataset class converts text into numerical data.
Sentiment Classification â€“ A PyTorch LSTM model predicts sentiment.
Google API Integration â€“ Reviews are also analyzed using Googleâ€™s Natural Language API to compare results.
Entity Extraction â€“ Both SpaCy and Googleâ€™s API extract key terms related to sentiment.
Current Performance
Since the model is trained on just 5 reviews, it isnâ€™t highly accurate yet. The PyTorch model misclassifies some reviews, while Googleâ€™s API is more reliable. However, this project highlights skills in PyTorch, NLP, and API integration. With more training data and better embeddings, the system could become production-ready. ðŸš€
